The repository was created as part of the assignment for the epigenomics course at the University of Vic and contains the following:
1. A simple script to determine whether a sequence is RNA or DNA. The appendix to the script allows for calculating the percentage of each nucleotide.
2. A separate script to calculate the percentage of each nucleotide in RNA or DNA sequences.
